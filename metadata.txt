about=This plugin runs a fill algorithm over a DEM to extract cells that are either upstream or downstream from a starting point and connected to it. It can extract :
		- basins : algorithm only fetches neighboring cells that are continuously upstream or downstream from one another (drain to/from the starting point)
		- altitudes : all connected cells that are above or below the starting elevation (creates an elevation mask).
	Please note :
		- the results are very dependent on the quality of the DEM, so make sure to fill the sinks in your DEM before running the plugin
		- the input coordinates must be in the same CRS as the DEM raster
		- if the result appears as an empty raster, try to reclassify it as "unique values" in the raster symbology tab
	This plugin was developed using Plugin Builder and Plugin Reloader. The algorithms were built upon bits of code found in the following ressources :
		- "Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python" (second edition) by Joel Lawhead (for the flood fill algorithm)
		- Master Degree course material by Nicolas Karasiak (writing/reading rasters with GDAL)
